# LASSO_Model
# Problem statement:
Using demographic (city, gender, age) and affinity categories (e.g., auto enthusiast, tech, etc.) from Google Analytics can we predict which covariates have a stronger impact on the reserve button.

# Business Case Value: 
This will allow us to better inform digital marketing budgets and target audience to maximize the number of click reservations. Similarly, results can be directional used to plan organic media content that aligns with the prediction variables.
